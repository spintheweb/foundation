# Mission

Spin the Web exists to empower creators, organizations, and communities to build, share, and evolve web portals in a more open, collaborative, and sustainable way. We believe the web should be accessible, adaptable, and driven by shared standards—not locked behind proprietary systems or fragmented by complexity.

Our mission is to:

- Develop and promote the Webbase Description Language (WBDL) as an open standard for describing entire web portals, making complex web experiences easier to create, maintain, and extend.
- Provide tools like Webspinner and Spin the Web Studio that enable both technical and non-technical users to design, manage, and collaborate on dynamic web content.
- Foster a global community where contributors of all backgrounds—developers, designers, educators, and advocates—can participate, learn, and shape the future of the web together.
- Champion transparency, inclusivity, and digital sustainability, ensuring that the web remains a space for innovation, creativity, and public good.

Spin the Web is passion-driven and community-powered, dedicated to weaving connections and keeping the web open for everyone.

## Integration Principle

We believe software should be built to integrate seamlessly into web portals. To that end, new applications are encouraged to expose a REST backend so they can be composed into portals via WBDL with a consistent, accessible user experience. For example, an ERP with a REST backend and a webbaselet-defined frontend can be dropped into a portal to provide a uniform UX alongside other systems—without rewriting the core application.
