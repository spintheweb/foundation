- **Respect for privacy and open licensing**


## How to Contribute

Spin the Web thrives on the creativity and expertise of contributors from many backgrounds. 

### UI/UX

If you are passionate about UI/UX, your skills are especially valuable. In our project, a “content” is a dynamic data unit that communicates with a datasource, receives a JSON response, and rendering in many ways—such as a table, list, Gantt chart, plot, tree, or graph. UI/UX contributors help design and prototype adaptable, accessible, and visually engaging components for these data types. Your work ensures that users can interact with complex, dynamic data in intuitive and meaningful ways. We encourage you to bring new ideas for visualizations, improve user flows, and test usability with real data and users. Your contributions will directly shape how people experience and understand the web through Spin the Web.


### WBDL Schema

WBDL (Webbase Description Language) is the heart of Spin the Web, much like HTML is for the traditional web. WBDL is designed to evolve, allowing deeper, more articulated, and precise ways of describing new behaviors and web experiences. Contributors can help shape the future of WBDL by proposing new schema elements, refining existing ones, or suggesting improvements for clarity and expressiveness. If you have ideas for new features, want to address limitations, or are interested in standards development, your input is highly valued. By contributing to the WBDL schema, you help ensure that Spin the Web remains flexible, powerful, and relevant as the web itself evolves.


### Communication & Teaching

Spin the Web is an open initiative to redefine how we describe, implement, and deliver web portals. It addresses the complexity and fragmentation of current web development by introducing a new standard—WBDL (Webbase Description Language)—that enables creators to describe entire web portals in a clear, modular, and collaborative way. By abstracting content, data, and presentation, Spin the Web empowers both technical and non-technical contributors to participate in building rich web experiences.

One of the project’s core goals is to make the web more accessible—not just in terms of usability for people with disabilities, but also by lowering the barriers for anyone to contribute, teach, or communicate about web technology. If you are passionate about explaining concepts, writing documentation, creating tutorials, or helping others understand the value and mechanics of Spin the Web, your skills are essential. You can help by writing guides, recording videos, leading workshops, or simply answering questions in the community. Your contributions will help make Spin the Web approachable and impactful for everyone.


### Documentation

A web portal is a unified, interactive gateway to information, services, and resources—often aggregating content from multiple sources and presenting it in a cohesive, user-friendly interface. Unlike a single-purpose website, a web portal brings together diverse data, tools, and user experiences under one roof, enabling users to access, manage, and interact with a wide range of content and functionality.

The fundamental parts of a web portal typically include:
- **Content units**: Dynamic modules that fetch and display data from various datasources, such as tables, lists, charts, or custom visualizations.
- **Navigation**: Menus, links, and structures that help users move between different sections and features.
- **User management**: Authentication, authorization, and personalization features that tailor the experience to each user.
- **Integration points**: Connectors to external systems, APIs, or services that enrich the portal’s capabilities.
- **Presentation layer**: The visual and interactive design that brings everything together in an accessible, engaging way.

If you enjoy clarifying concepts, writing clear explanations, or creating diagrams and examples, your documentation skills are invaluable. Help us make Spin the Web and web portals understandable for everyone!
