# Governance – Spin the Web

Spin the Web is a personally-driven open source project managed transparently and openly. At present, the project is not funded in any way—it exists and grows thanks entirely to the passion, dedication, and voluntary contributions of its community. As the community grows, one of our objectives is to secure sponsorship or funding to help finance and sustain these efforts, ensuring continued progress and support for all contributors.
