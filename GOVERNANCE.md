# Governance – Spin the Web

Spin the Web is a personally-driven open source project managed transparently and openly. At present, the project is not funded in any way—it exists and grows thanks entirely to the passion, dedication, and voluntary contributions of its community. As the community grows, one of our objectives is to secure sponsorship or funding to help finance and sustain these efforts, ensuring continued progress and support for all contributors.

## Mission
To promote digital transformation, open standards, and social impact through open collaboration and transparent funding.

- Major decisions are made by community consensus and core contributors

## Design Principles

### Integration Principle

Spin the Web promotes a composition-first architecture: applications expose REST backends and are presented in portals via WBDL-defined webbaselets, enabling a consistent and accessible user experience across systems. This principle is inclusive of both open and paid software. Participation does not require relinquishing licensing models; REST interactions can be monitored and reported using transparent, privacy-respecting telemetry to support usage insights, accountability, and potential sponsorship.

## Roles
