# Spin the Web

Spin the Web is an open, personally-driven project for digital transformation and open web standards. All development and governance are managed openly and transparently.

## Integration Principle

Software should integrate seamlessly into web portals. We encourage new applications to expose a REST backend so they can be composed via WBDL and presented through webbaselets with a consistent, accessible UX. This principle welcomes both open and paid software; REST interactions can be monitored and governed transparently. Learn more in our [Mission](./MISSION.md#integration-principle).
